  <p>
    When it comes to ranking high on Google, content is no longer just about keywords it’s about quality and credibility. That’s where 
    <span class="highlight">EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness)</span> comes in. Google uses these principles to evaluate how reliable and valuable your content is. Let’s break it down:
  </p>

  <h2>1. Experience</h2>
  <p>
    Google looks for real-world, hands-on knowledge in your content. This means sharing personal insights, case studies, examples, or customer stories that prove you’ve actually worked with or used what you’re writing about.
  </p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> A fitness coach sharing their own transformation story has more credibility than a generic article.</p>

  <h2>2. Expertise</h2>
  <p>
    Expertise is about showing you know your field inside out. Content should be accurate, well-researched, and fact-checked. Using credentials, certifications, or citing reliable sources adds weight to your authority.
  </p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> A doctor writing about health tips will naturally carry more expertise than a random blogger.</p>

  <h2>3. Authoritativeness</h2>
  <p>
    Being an authority means your content and brand are recognized as a trusted voice in your industry. This comes from backlinks, mentions, partnerships, and media features that validate your credibility.
  </p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> If top industry websites reference your content, it signals to Google that you’re a leader in the space.</p>

  <h2>4. Trustworthiness</h2>
  <p>
    Trust is the foundation of EEAT. Visitors should feel safe and confident when engaging with your content or website. This includes transparent information, accurate claims, secure website practices (HTTPS), clear policies, and authentic reviews/testimonials.
  </p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> An eCommerce site with secure checkout, clear return policies, and visible contact information builds higher trust.</p>

  <h2>Why EEAT is Crucial for Your Business</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Helps rank higher on Google search results</li>
    <li>Builds brand reputation and credibility</li>
    <li>Attracts the right audience and increases conversions</li>
    <li>Strengthens customer loyalty through trust</li>
  </ul>
